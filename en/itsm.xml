    <title>OTRS::ITSM - The OTRS for IT service management</title>
    <para>IT is expected to deliver consistently high service quality in an increasingly complex field. In this context, effective and efficient incident and problem management are indispensable. However, IT service management remains a task almost impossible if there is no consistent and up-to-date database with information about the state and configuration of the IT infrastructure. </para>
    <para>The IT Infrastructure Library�, short ITIL�, is a series of books published by the United Kingdom's Office of Government Commerce (OGC), which generically combine best practice approaches to designing, providing, operating and managing IT services. ITIL does not center the technology but the services provided by the IT and comprises information on processes, roles, responsibilities, potential problem fields/resolutions and definitions of terms.</para>
    <para>ITIL has established itself as de facto standard over the past years and its circulation in IT organizations contributed considerably to the development of a collective awareness and consistent terminology for IT service management. However, ITIL only describes &quot;who should do what&quot; and what should be considered along the way. In order to cover as wide a user group as possible, it does not or only rudimentarily address the issue of how to do things. Therefore, no implementable information is given for particular industries, companies or manufacturers. </para>
    <para>In December 2005, the ITIL based ISO/IEC 20000 industry standard for IT service management was published. IT organizations can apply for ISO/IEC 20000 certification and prove their conformity. </para>
    <para>The continuing boom caused demand for IT service management tools, which could represent the ITIL-based processes. So far, only proprietary solutions existed. Because of their considerable complexity, most of these tools are only affordable for large companies and effective in large IT departments.</para>
    <para>The development of OTRS::ITSM was initiated as a logical consequence of the great success of the Open Ticket Request System OTRS in order to combine the globally accepted, public ITIL recommendations with the benefits of open-source software. </para>
    <para>OTRS::ITSM 1.0 was the first real-world ITIL compliant IT service management solution on open-source basis, built on the solid fundament of over 55,000 known OTRS installations and the related active community (information dating from April 2007). OTRS::ITSM is under permanent development and new ITIL topics are added continously.</para>
    <para>Core objective of the development of OTRS::ITSM is a strong praxis orientation. This aim can be accomplished by the close development collaboration with Enterprise Consulting GmbH from Bad Homburg, which is very experienced in the practical application of ITIL. Additionally to providing ITSM consulting services and solutions, Enterprise operates complete ITIL compliant IT organizations for renowned customers. </para>
    <para>The service-desk and ticket system solution OTRS forms the basis for the operation of the ITIL compliant IT service management solution OTRS::ITSM, its incident management, problem management, service level management and configuration management modules and the integrated CMDB.</para>
    <para>OTRS::ITSM and OTRS are freely available (no license fees apply) and are subject to GNU General Public License (GPL).</para>

    <title>Features</title>
    <para>OTRS::ITSM 1.1 is based on the Open Ticket Request System OTRS 2.2. All functionalities known from OTRS continue to be available and the functionalities representing ITIL processes can be installed as packages.
</para>
    <para>Several improvements were effected on the core product OTRS in the course of the OTRS::ITSM development. </para>

        <title>New features in OTRS framework 2.2</title>
        <itemizedlist>
        <title>The The OTRS framework features relevant for OTRS::ITSM are:</title>
        <listitem>
            <para>Services and SLAs: The new attributes "service" and "service level agreements (SLA)" were integrated in OTRS 2.2 on its way to becoming an IT service management tool. When creating a ticket, the customer can select a service (e.g. e-mail service) and a corresponding SLA. SLA attributes are &quot;response time&quot;, &quot;update time&quot; and &quot;solution time&quot;. IT service can use these attributes for notifications or ticket escalation in order to meet existing SLAs. Service and SLA specific information in the header of new e-mails can be analyzed as usual with the PostMaster filter module.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Native ticket types are supported: Various ticket types can be managed in the admin interface. Free-text fields are therefore no longer needed to specify ticket types. Installations using free-text fields for ticket type classification do not have to be migrated. The new feature is also shown in the ticket content and in the print view for agents and customers and can be adjusted in the agent interface. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Change of the internal OTRS structure for saving customer data: Saving of customer data was restructured and subdivided into &quot;CustomerCompany&quot; and &quot;CustomerUser&quot; objects. Company specific data, as for example the company name, company address etc., are maintained separately from the person specific data (first and last name, title etc.). </para>

                    Services can be assigned to authorized customers. Further more,
                    services may be assigned as general 'default services' which are
                    valid to use for each customer.

            <listitem>
                <para>Structured Service/CI view</para>
                <para>
                    A structured tree view on services and CIs including information
                    on each objects current state allows to analyse an incident
                    and calculate the incidents impact on affected services and
                    customers.

                    As an enhancement of the service view, now SLAs and linked CIs are displayed too.
                    For each CI the current incident state is shown. Also, the incident state
                    will be propagated for dependent SLAs and CIs.

                    If a service is selected, the service details will be shown, now with the additional
                    'current incident state', which is calculated from the incident states of dependent
                    services and CIs.
                </para>
                <para>
                    CIs are now enhanced with a 'current incident state', which includes two state types:

                <para>
                    For each state type any number of states can be registered.
                    The state of a CI affects the service state, which will be dynamically calculated, and can
                    have one of the following three values:

                    The import and export is controlled with ImEx definitions. These definitions map the columns of the CSV file to the fields in the CMDB. You can create an ImEx definition via the admin interface in OTRS. For each available field in the CMDB, the corresponding column in the CSV file needs to be defined. This is done in a form, which represents the current CI definition. Also, a filter can be applied, to limit the number of the exported CIs.
                    Any number of ImEx definitions can be stored in the system, and each definition can be used for import and for export.

                    To start an import (exports work the same way), two possibilities exist: interactive with the web interface, or automatically with a script.
                    Using the interactive way, the desired ImEx definition is selected, and then the CSV file is uploaded to the system. During the interactive export, the CSV file will be offered for download respectively.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The automatic import is carried out via a script, which needs the name of the ImEx definition and the name of the CSV file as arguments. During the script based export, the CIs that were given the script as arguments, will be saved in a CSV file.
                    Before the execution of the import or export, the selected ImEx definition will be compared with the current CI definition. If inconsistencies were found, the process will be cancelled. Also, during import, restrictions in the CI definition (e.g. mandatory fields) will be checked. If applicable, the data record is rejected, but the import process continues. An import protocol can be found in the syslog.
                    Via the API the CSV based import/export can be replaced or enhanced by other formats/transports, like direct database access or XML. The implementation of the CSV interface can be used as a reference.
